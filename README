Running normal mode analysis:
1) Copy this folder to the directory containing your VIBxyz.xyz output.
	Usually cp -r nmode_analysis_setup {path}/normal_modes/vib/

Run 0 ps trajectory for each mode to get required CMD files (can be run on local machines):
1) Set the number of water molecules in add_disp.sh and edit the DLPOLY location.
2) Set s (first mode) and nmodes in add_disp.sh.
3) Edit MB-mu and MB-alpha code locations in compute_dip_pol.sh.
4) Run ./add_disp.sh

Compute dipole moments and polarizability tensors for desired modes (setup to run on TSCC):
1) Edit the CONTROL and FIELD files in the files/ directory for your system.
2) Edit the files in split_runs for your setup:
	in run_pack-dip_pol.sh, edit the EXE locations.
3) Submit jobs with ./submit_jobs.sh first_mode last_mode.
	(Range of mode values can span more than 16 modes)

Compute instantaneous derivative approximations (fast, can be done on local machines):
1) Set the number of water molecules in your system in calc_dip_pol.sh.
2) Run ./calc_dip_pol.sh first_mode last_mode
